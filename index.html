                <h2>My history with coding and how i got started</h2>
                <p>I started learning how to code in the spring of 2025, I took a class called Data Structure and Algorithms in community college where i learned about things such as java,
                    and terms such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. After that class i wanted to learn more about coding so i started learning web development on my own using free resources
                    such as freecodecamp and w3schools. </p>
                    <p>I have been learning web development for about 6 months now and have made some simple projects such as a portfolio website and a to-do list app.
                    In my time using freecodecamp I have gained experience with HTML, CSS, and I am currently learning javascript. I am still currently learning more and more about web development and hope to become a full-stack developer.</p>

                    <h3>My life story</h3>
                    <p>I was born in Summerfield, NC in 2000. At first when i was born Doctors weren't sure if i would make it. Over the years i have gone from almost not making it to being fully independent now. Ever since i found out about coding and what i am capable of when i put my mind to something i am truly passionate about, 
                    I have fell in love with it and find it very relaxing when I want to make something. I still have a lot of work to do for this portfolio but it is going to be something i work on for a while in order to show employers in the future.</p>
